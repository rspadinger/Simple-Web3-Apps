# Decentralized Escrow Application

This is an Escrow Dapp built with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Setup

Install dependencies in the top-level directory with `npm install`.

Create a .env file and provide all required keys that are listed in .ENV-EXAMPLE

After you have installed hardhat locally, you can use commands to test and compile the contracts, among other things. To learn more about these commands run `npx hardhat help`.

Compile the contracts using `npx hardhat compile`. The artifacts will be placed in the `/app` folder, which will make it available to the front-end. This path configuration can be found in the `hardhat.config.js` file.

## Front-End

To run the front-end application run `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
